I have set up my work environment for this project, so tomorrow it will be all ready for me to work on. I have all of my files ready to go. I learned a lot today about sass and I look forward to learning more tomorrow.

Good morning, I am about to dive back into this course. I am excited that it is almost over because I am learning a lot on the back end of it - mainly about sass and good practices and shortcuts and quality of life things like these.

I completed the Header and Main Nav section of this project. I am learning how to structure my sass using multiple partial stylesheets and importing them into the main sass file. I also am learning how to use the nesting ability to a greater extent. We used a new syntax (^) and this let me add styleing to any class that started with a certain word, but I did not have to select the entire class name. In the example on this project I included a hover effect to any button, link, or imput whose class name started with btn-

Completed Specialize & Stats Section. It was pretty straight forward, I am re-iterating nesting patterns mostly here. It is a bit intimidating because I feel like I just got pretty good at formating my css and now sass formatting is a bit differant. Im not 100% sure that I like all of what it has to offer, but as I use it more im sure ill pick and choose what i want to use from it. All and all I am learning right now which makes me happy

Completed Process & Footer Section. We used a sass function again so it was nice to see that in action once more - these are a bit confusing but functions in general are still a bit confusing to me (I will study javascript after making a few portfolio pieces to showcase my css skills). The one we used here was just a conditional. I am noticing we used line heignt width and height all equal when creating our icon styleings. we could use a mixing for that part because they all had those similar as well as a border-radius.
[11:03am]
Completed about page info section. I ran into a few issues on this section with placing elements outside of the div's they were supposed to be in, but I was able to look at my code and think about it and troubleshoot all of the issues i was having all by myself. I feel like I am learning a lot when I think about it. We used grid area this time and I dont really see why I would use this instead of the template columns so far, it seems like a lot of extra markup to assign the classes to grid area names.
