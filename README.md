I have set up my work environment for this project, so tomorrow it will be all ready for me to work on. I have all of my files ready to go. I learned a lot today about sass and I look forward to learning more tomorrow.

Good morning, I am about to dive back into this course. I am excited that it is almost over because I am learning a lot on the back end of it - mainly about sass and good practices and shortcuts and quality of life things like these.

I completed the Header and Main Nav section of this project. I am learning how to structure my sass using multiple partial stylesheets and importing them into the main sass file. I also am learning how to use the nesting ability to a greater extent. We used a new syntax (^) and this let me add styleing to any class that started with a certain word, but I did not have to select the entire class name. In the example on this project I included a hover effect to any button, link, or imput whose class name started with btn- .
